- exclude files/dirs from checksumming or only instead of blacklisting only checksum whitelisted
- less logs?
- test _cl_* functions directly if they do more than just setting options and call a func
- refactor to only use abspath interally (only when writing to hash file use relpath)
- report file for verifying ops
